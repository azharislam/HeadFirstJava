# HeadFirstJava

# What is this?

This is my first full git repository. It records my progress as I go through the "HeadFirst Java" book by O'Reilly. I read through each chapter and did the practical work using Eclipse IDE. I then set up a repo here to track my work and get used to Git and to also record my understanding of Java.
